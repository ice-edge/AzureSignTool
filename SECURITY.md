# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

AzureSignTool and AzureSign.Core currently only support the latest version. Use [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/vcsjones/AzureSignTool/releases/latest) to determine the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### GitHub

Security issues or vulnerabilties should be reported privately using GitHub's vulnerability reporting. This option is available on the "Security" section in this repository. Additional information is available on the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

### E-mail

If using GitHub reports is not preferred or you do not have a GitHub account, email at kevin@vcsjones.dev is acceptable. If neccessary, email content can be encrypted using [age](https://filippo.io/age) using the following recipient key:

```plain
age17x2jh56d7p7jpvqc8v4y4lz24w6g9r9zhkv6x4fvvg680ccew55qvktvvt
```

E-mail responses and handling will be slower than using the GitHub provided mechanism.
